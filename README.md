# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener where it may not reliably reflect server-side changes to authentication status.  Specifically, if an administrator deletes a user account on the server, the client-side listener may not immediately (or at all) trigger an update.  This can lead to inconsistencies in application state and unexpected behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Follow the instructions to set up a Firebase project.
3. Run the `onAuthStateChangedBug.js` script to observe the behavior.
4. Note that the `onAuthStateChanged` listener may not update immediately if you simultaneously delete the user from the Firebase console. 
5.  Run the `onAuthStateChangedSolution.js` script to see the improved behavior.  

## Solution
The `onAuthStateChangedSolution.js` offers a solution to this problem by incorporating additional mechanisms for handling server-side authentication changes, which can increase the reliability and responsiveness of your application.
